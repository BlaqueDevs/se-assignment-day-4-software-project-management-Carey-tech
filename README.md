Agile methodology is a flexible and adaptive method that allows the developers to flexibly submit their work in small phases allowing collaboration eg website creation while waterfall is a rigid linear methodology whaere you must finish one phase before going on to the next.eg during construction or a transaction app.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each? 
agile can be great in websites while waterfall is best in commerce  or shopping apps.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
Software solution is the purpose, features of a software and the benefits of that software outlining the problems it will solve.

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
1. User friendly interface
2. high perfomance software
3. strong security features
4. regular updates and improvement.
5. customer support
6. advanced functionalityeg automation
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
1.market size
2. market growth rate
3. market trends
4. market demand
5. competition


## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
this helps to shape the software to fit in the market and identifying the competition expected.
